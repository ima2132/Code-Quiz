## Description 
This project marks the implementation of JavaScript and web APIS into a timed quiz. The main objective is to create an application that presents the user with coding questions and are penalized through time deduction if they answer incorrectly. At the end of the quiz, the user can enter their initials, view their score, and save their record. 

This project is also a great way to test one's coding knowledge and/or in preparation of a technical round of a job interview. 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

To use this application, users can click to start the quiz. Users have an allotted time of 90 seconds to answer each question. If they get a question wrong, time will be deducted from the clock.
