## Description 
This project marks the implementation of JavaScript and web APIS into a timed quiz. The main objective is 
to develop an application that offers users a series of coding questions. If users provide incorrect answers, they will be penalized by having time deducted from their remaining time. Upon completing the quiz, users will have the opportunity to enter their initials, view their score, and save their record for future reference.

This project is also a great way to test one's coding knowledge and/or in preparation of a technical round of a job interview. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
To utilize this application, simply click on the deployed link. Users may begin the quiz by clicking on the designated start button. There are 8 questions that must be answered within a time limit of 90 seconds. Should a user provide an incorrect response, time will be subtracted from the remaining countdown. 

Users will have access to view the questions they answered correctly and incorrectly right after answering the question. Upon completing the quiz, they will be prompted to enter their initials and store their final score. They can clear their score and restart the quiz if they wish to.
