## Description 
This project marks the implementation of JavaScript and web APIS into a timed quiz. The main objective is 
to develop an application that offers users a series of coding questions. If users provide incorrect answers, they will be penalized by having time deducted from their remaining time. Upon completing the quiz, users will have the opportunity to enter their initials, view their score, and save their record for future reference.

This project is also a great way to test one's coding knowledge and/or in preparation of a technical round of a job interview. 

## User Story
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. 

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
To utilize this application, simply click on the deployed link. Users may begin the quiz by clicking on the designated start button. Each question must be answered within a time limit of 60 seconds. Should a user provide an incorrect response, time will be subtracted from the remaining countdown. 

Upon completing the quiz, users will be prompted to enter their initials and store their final score. They will have access to view the questions they answered correctly and incorrectly.
